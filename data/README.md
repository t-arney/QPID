# Which file(s) do I need?

Depending on your workflow, you will want different files. The authoritative version is the group of separate CSV files in this folder, but you might find the files in the [compiled](./compiled) folder easier:

- for **R** users, use the [RDS file](./compiled/qpid.rds) in the compiled folder;
- for **MATLAB** users, use the [MAT file](./compiled/qpid.mat) in the compiled folder;
- if you use another programming language, use the CSV files in this folder
- if you don't know how to use any programming language or you just want a quick overview, you can use the [Excel workbook](./compiled/QPID.xlsx)
- as a last resort, the full dataset as [one CSV file](./compiled/qpid_full_dataset.csv) is available, though you may have to be careful as it is a large file.
